<h2 id="viscoelastic-properties-of-cytoplasm">Viscoelastic properties of cytoplasm</h2>
<div align="justify">
  <p style="padding:0px; margin:0px"> The cell cytoplasm is a complex composition of interacting components, including proteins, cytoskeletal networks, granules, and organelles ranging in size from nanometers to tens of microns. 
      This intricate arrangement enables the cytoplasm to exhibit viscoelasticity, deforming under applied forces and partially returning to its original shape upon force removal.
      This property is crucial in cellular processes such as division, intracellular transport, and migration, ensuring cells can withstand mechanical stresses, adapt to their environment,
      and maintain structural integrity. Various factors like cytoskeletal components and molecular crowding modulate cytoplasmic viscoelasticity. 
  </p>

  <p style="padding:0px; margin:0px"> My current research focuses on identifying major viscoelasticity regulators and investigating how different organelles perceive this property concerning their functions. Using 
      magnetic tweezers, I have discovered that in the absence of microtubules contacting the cell cortex, viscoelasticity of the cytoplasm can keep the spindle or
      large passive oil droplets in a stable position representing viscoelasticity is a nonspecific property of the cell. Additionally, my work demonstrates that hydrodynamic 
      interactions significantly reduce the mobility of objects within the cytoplasm, particularly for organelles approaching the size of the cell. This finding implies that the cytoplasm 
      hydrodynamically couples large organelles to the cell surface, influencing their motion and impacting cell shape sensing and organization. COMSOL simulations supported the experimental results.

<h2 id="bacterial-motility-with-various-numbers-of-flagella">Bacterial motility with various numbers of flagella</h2>
<div align="justify">
  <p style="padding:0px; margin:0px"> Bacterial species propel themselves through aqoues medium using rotating flagella. One regular flagellation pattern is the helical arrangement of flagella around the entire cell body
      known as peritrichous flagellation. Each flagellum anchores to a reversible rotary motor within the cell membrane capable of switching between clockwise and counterclockwise rotation. 
      When all flagella rotate counterclockwise, they form a synchronized bundle allowing the bacterium to move forward smoothly (run phase). However, the bundle get partially disrupted when
      some flagella change their rotational direction leading to slower self-propelled motion and facilitating changes in propoltion path (tumble phase). The run-and-tumble dynamics enable bacteria
      to revise their movement and adjust their speed and run time in response to environmental changes caused by temperature, light, or chemical gradients. This ability substentially enhances their
      search efficiency enabling optimal navigation towards favorable areas or away from harmful regions. The evolutionary reasons behind flagellar numbers adjustment in bacterial species remain
      under debate.
  </p>

  <p style="padding:0px; margin:0px"> I examined the swimming dynamics of differentially flagellated Bacillus subtilis strains in a quasiâ€“two-dimensional system. I developed algorithms to identify rare tumbling events from
      noisy speed signals and discovered that reducing the number of flagella decreases the average turning angle between successive run phases. This accordingly enhances the run time and 
      directional persistence of the run phase. Therefore, having fewer flagella proves beneficial for long-distance transport and rapid spreading, while having higher flagella is advantageous
      for slower spreading processes. Numerical simulations using a two-phase model for stochastic random walk indicated that the optimal flagellar number lies within intermediate values optimizing
      the efficiency of searching and exploring the environment. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that the number of bundles remains independent of flagellar number where the formation of three bundles
      being the most frequent occurrence. Additionally, I observed that while there is no significant difference in bundle width and length, the projected angle between the bundles increases with
      flagellar number, plausibly resulting in wider turning angles for strains with a higher number of flagella. Furthermore, I found an anti-correlation between swimming speed and the projected
      angle between bundles, with an increasing wobbling angle between swimming direction and cell body as the number of flagella increases. 
  </p>

  <p style="padding:0px; margin:0px"> Moreover, I investigated the collective dynamics of bacterial strains in highly concentrated suspensions, swarming colonies on agar plates, and biofilm growth. However,
       the results of these studies have yet to be published.
