<h2 id="viscoelastic-properties-of-cytoplasm">Viscoelastic properties of cytoplasm</h2>
The cell cytoplasm is a complex composition of interacting components, including proteins, cytoskeletal networks, granules, and organelles ranging in size from nanometers to tens of microns. 
This intricate arrangement enables the cytoplasm to exhibit viscoelasticity, deforming under applied forces and partially returning to its original shape upon force removal.
This property is crucial in cellular processes such as division, intracellular transport, and migration, ensuring cells can withstand mechanical stresses, adapt to their environment,
and maintain structural integrity. Various factors like cytoskeletal components and molecular crowding modulate cytoplasmic viscoelasticity. <\br>

My research focuses on identifying major viscoelasticity regulators and investigating how different organelles perceive this property concerning their functions. Using 
  magnetic tweezers, I have discovered that in the absence of microtubules contacting the cell cortex, viscoelasticity of the cytoplasm can keep the spindle or
  large passive oil droplets in a stable position representing viscoelasticity is a nonspecific property of the cell. Additionally, my work demonstrates that hydrodynamic 
  interactions significantly reduce the mobility of objects within the cytoplasm, particularly for organelles approaching the size of the cell. This finding implies that the cytoplasm 
  hydrodynamically couples large organelles to the cell surface, influencing their motion and impacting cell shape sensing and organization. COMSOL simulations supported the experimental results. <\br>

Ongoing studies involve investigating how cell geometry modifies the viscoelasticity experienced by organelles. <\br>
