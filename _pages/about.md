<div align="justified">
As a soft matter physicist with a background in material science and extensive experience in biophysics and quantitative biology, I have a passion for solving complex problems at the intersection of data science, physics, material science, and biology. With broad international research experience in interdisciplinary science, I specialize in the collection, analysis, and modeling of complex data to draw meaningful insights and patterns out of them.


I've been fortunate to work on a range of exciting interdisciplinary projects, including studying the mechanical properties of the cell cytoplasm and its influence on proper cell division, bacterial diffusion, biofilm growth, swarming, and collective motion of bacteria with varying individual cell properties. I've also worked on the compaction and deformation of thin, slender elastic, and plastic objects. My expertise includes a variety of experimental and computational techniques such as microscopy, image processing, rheology, Finite Element Method (FEM), Monte Carlo, analytical modeling, and data analysis.


I am eager to apply my skills and expertise to solve challenging problems in any research and development or data-driven role. My interdisciplinary research experience and proficiency in modeling and data analysis make me well-suited for a range of positions in both industry and academia. Please explore the other tabs on this page for additional information about my work.
